      <h2 style="text-align: left">Hello {{mentee.firstName}},</h2>
      <p>
        We hope this message finds you well. We wanted to provide you with an
        update regarding your recent mentorship request with
        {{mentor.firstName}} {{mentor.lastName}} on MentorsHub.
      </p>
      <p>
        {{mentor.firstName}} has reviewed your application and, after careful
        consideration, has chosen not to proceed with your mentorship request at
        this time. We understand that this might be disappointing, but please
        know that there are various factors that mentors consider when reviewing
        requests.
      </p>

      <p>Here's what you can do next:</p>
      <p>
        <b>Explore Other Mentors: </b>Mentors have unique expertise and
        availability. If your request has been declined by one mentor, it
        doesn't mean you can't find the perfect mentor elsewhere on MentorsHub.
        Feel free to explore other mentor profiles and submit requests to
        mentors who align with your goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Review and Refine: </b> Take a moment to review your mentorship
        request. Ensure that it accurately reflects your goals and objectives.
        You can refine your request before submitting it to another mentor.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Stay Positive:</b> Mentorship is about finding the right fit, and
        sometimes it takes a few attempts. Don't be discouraged; there are many
        experienced mentors on MentorsHub eager to guide you.
